#zero-inflated model, not working with gamm() or gamm4()
#error
# You can't use these extended families outside of gam() or bam() from the mgcv package.
# With gamm4 you're stuck with the families that lmer() and glmer() 
# from the lme4 package supports.
# Options would be to use the gamlss package for ZIP models 
# as I don't think it has a Tweedie family, or use the glmmTMB package 
# which has lots of options, including tw() for a Tweedie family, however 
# I don't believe it understands smooths so you'd need to convert your 
# model into a form that can be fitted as a mixed effects model.
# # Another option, which is likely to be inefficient but which you 
# can use to get started with immediately is to use the "re" basis spline 
# with gam() or bam() and create a factor or name nested in party to use
# as the random effect, or even just s(name, party, bs = 're') might do it, 
# assuming both are factors, but do the help for this basis to make sure 
# I'm interpreting what you intend for the random effect.
